# World-City-Weather-App
A stylish weather app for world cities that utilises OpenWeatherApp's API. 
Features dynamic backgrounds and icons that reflect the weather and conditions, and option to select between imperial and metric units.

Simply type the name of any city in the world into the search bar, and go.

The program should catch any incorrect spellings and non-existent cities in the console or via an alert.
